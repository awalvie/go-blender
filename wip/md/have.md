### Hardware

I possess a lot of tools thanks to a very generous family.

- Work Laptop**: Macbook Pro 13
- Personal Laptop**: Alienware 13R3
- Tablet**: iPad Pro 11
- Headphones**: Sony WF1000 XM3
- Earphones**: Realme Buds Q2
- Keyboard**: GMMK White Ice TKL

### Software

- Personal Operating System**: Darwin/PopOS
- Text Editor/IDE**: Neovim + Tmux
- Browser**: Firefox
- Shell**: ZSH
- Static Site Generator**: lyceum
- RSS Reader**: [yarr](https://github.com/nkanaev/yarr)

I like to run stock configurations so that I'm never shackled by my current distribution and have the ability to freely switch if I find something interesting.

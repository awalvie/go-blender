hi, I’m awalvie, also known as vishesh in the real world and welcome to my little corner on the
internet. I am starting this website as a way of motivating myself into making meaningful
contributions to open source software, improve my writing skills (which you will be noticing
throughout the blog are completely garbage) and being more accountable.

my weekends start with a nice

```
mkdir super_awesome_project
```

and end with

```
rm -rf ./super_awesome_project
```

The social skills I lack (as pointed out by my parents), I like to think I make up for by having a
high amount of curiosity, love for computers and addiction to coffee. I am always interested in
talking to people to share ideas and solve problems, feel free to shoot a DM or email if you want to
reach out.

I also like reading books and will be writing about them, these won’t be reviews but just my thoughts
put on paper.

The website is currently hosted via Github Pages [here](https://github.com/awalvie/lyceum).
